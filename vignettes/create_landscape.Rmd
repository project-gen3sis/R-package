To create your own landscape, you can start from anywere. For this exercise we will create from scratch a simple island landscape that we used in the main text of the package manuscript as case study 1.


## Create your landscape grid

In this example we want to explores biodiversity dynamics and trait evolution on dynamic oceanic islands. It follows the general dynamic model of island biogeography (Whittaker et al. 2008 Journal of Biogeography), the island we create entails the number of sites and environmental dynamics.

We will now create the landscape files for the experiment. First, we will define the spatial extent of our landscape, i.e. the number of sites. In our case, this will be 31 by 31 cells. Next we specify that our landscape should evolve over 140 time steps.

```{r eval=FALSE}
Ncol<-31
Nrow<-31
Ntimesteps<-140
```

The next step will be to create two empty 3 dimensional arrays (2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension). In here, we will save the environmental variable values for the landscape file. Additionally we create two matrices (again, one for each environmental variable) which will later serve for the calculation of the distance matrices input files. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create the temperature array and matrix:
My_Dynamic_Landscape<-array(NA,dim=c(Nrow,Ncol,Ntimesteps))
My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe<-matrix(NA,nrow=Nrow*Ncol, ncol=length(c(Ncol,Nrow))+Ntimesteps)

#Create the precipitation array and matrix:
My_Dynamic_Landscape2<-array(NA,dim=c(Nrow,Ncol,Ntimesteps))
My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe2<-matrix(NA,nrow=Nrow*Ncol, ncol=length(c(Ncol,Nrow))+Ntimesteps)

#Creating a vector for the names to be used to name input files (one per time step) 
stringtimestepsnames<-vector(mode="character",length=Ntimesteps)
```



## Add environmental characteristics
Now that our template arrays and matrices are prepared, we can start to fill them with environmental values. We will use three nested loops to do so. The first loop iterates over the 140 time steps, while the two inner ones iterate over all spatial cells. We thus create the enironmental values which will be saved in the corresponding landscape arrays and therefore generate a heterogenous and temporally dynamic landscape.

Here we consider a conceptual island whose number of sites and heterogeneity vary over time, as shown in animation A1. The island is initiated with four sites (at 140 Ma), but the island surface progressively increases to its maximum of 81 sites (at 90 Ma) and then shrinks back to four sites at the present time (due to erosion). For each time step we will create a temperature and precipitation layer following a normal distribution.



```{r tidy=T, out.width='100%', echo=F, fig.cap='A1: Animation of the conceptual island that we will create as an input landscape for gen3sis.', fig.margin=T}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/extdata/CaseStudy1/landscape/case_study_landscape.gif")
```


For both temperature and precipitation we create a uniform distribution of the values over space and then add environmental white noise to introduce spatial and temporal heterogenity. For the temperature layer this will be an average of 20°C with a standard deviation of 0.5°C, where as for precipitation we settle for an average value of 500 mm/year with a standard deviation of 50 mm/year.

We however only want to assign these environmental values to the sites where we have land mass, according to the animation above. Within the loops we therefore check if we are indeed on a land-based site at the current time, and if so, we will assign a temperature and precipitation value to this site. 


Finally, we create one dataframe to store the temperature values for all time steps and a second dataframe for the precipitation values. These dataframes contain all possible x- and y-coordinates of our sample world as the first two columns. After the temperature and precipitation values have been created for one specific time step, we store these values within a new column in these new dataframes.

<!--
At the end of each time step we will calculate the distance from each habitable site to all others and store the results in form of a matrix. We will then save the distance matrix for each time step on our hard drive.

        }
      }
      #Saving the environmental variables in a dataframe format for distance matrices
      if(timestep==1){
        My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe[counting,1]<-x
        My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe[counting,2]<-y

      My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe2[counting,2+timestep]<-My_Dynamic_Landscape2[x,y,timestep]
      counting<-counting+1
    }
  }
}
```


The create_input() function of the *gen3sis* package takes temperature and precipitation values as a list raster layers or raster layer filenames. Based on the dataframes we just created, we can now create temperature and precipitation rasters for each time step. We then store them in a named list and save them to the hard drive.


```{r eval=FALSE}
landscapes_list <- list()
for (timestep in 1:Ntimesteps){ 
  My_Dynamic_Landscape_temp_r <- rasterFromXYZ(My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe_temp[, c(1,2, timestep+2)])
  My_Dynamic_Landscape_temp_r <- rasterFromXYZ(My_Dynamic_Landscape_dataframe_temp[, c(1,2, timestep+2)])
  
  landscapes_list$temp <- c(landscapes_list$temp, My_Dynamic_Landscape_temp_r)
  landscapes_list$prec <- c(landscapes_list$temp, My_Dynamic_Landscape_prec_r)
}

##saving the list of rasters into .rds format to be used as input
saveRDS(landscapes_list, "input/my_experiment/landscapes.rds")
```


## Add a cost function
The connection cost between sites is defined as the distance between these sites, modified by an optional cost function. This user defined cost function can give a penalty (or benefit) for crossing certain cells. For this virtual landscape, we will not add a cost function. If you want to learn how to implement one, please refer to the [create_input_landscape.html](create_input_landscape vignette).



<!--
The distance matrix for each time step between either: (i) full distance, containing all habitable cells in the landscape (faster computing speed, larger storage required), or (ii) local distance, containing a list of distance matrices of each cell with its 16 neighbors (slower computing speed, smaller storage required). Local distances matrix are built at each timestep with equal dimension to the full distances during a simulation run.The real geographic coordinate system can be provided which allows for the global spherical distance correction. For real landscapes, the distance unit is in meters (m). In the case of hypothetical landscapes, geographic distance is measured in units of sites. The model uses serialized R files (rds) format for all inputs. The functions for processing the input data in the required format are available in the package. The package offers two options to create distance matrices: one can either compute a (i) full distance matrix at each time step, or compute a (ii) local distance matrix of all cells containing the distances between neighbouring cells. The former option will lead to faster simulations, while the latter uses less storage space. Once the data is processed, the simulation can be started with the function ‘run_simulation’.’
